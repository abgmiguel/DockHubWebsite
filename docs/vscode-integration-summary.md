# VSCode Integration - Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

Successfully created a system to send component selections from the multi-tenant dashboard directly to the VSCode extension's chat input box.

## Changes Made

### 1. Dashboard (Astro Multi-Tenant)
- **Created**: `/astro-multi-tenant/src/pages/index.astro` - Dashboard with iframe and component selection
- **Modified**: `DevModeOverlay.tsx` - Detects dashboard mode and changes checkbox behavior to "Select"
- **Modified**: `ComponentOverlay.tsx` - Shows different UI in dashboard mode (green selection indicators)

### 2. VSCode Extension
- **Modified**: `UICommandMessageService.ts` - Added `fillChatInput` action handler
- **Modified**: `ChatPanel.tsx` - Added listener for `fillChatInput` command
- **Modified**: `chat-commands.ts` - Updated `codersinflow.sendMessage` command to fill chat input

## How It Works

### Message Flow
```
1. Dashboard formats message with selected components
2. Triggers VSCode command: vscode://command/codersinflow.sendMessage?args=["message"]
3. Command gets ReactChatViewProvider instance
4. Sends fillChatInput command to webview
5. ChatPanel receives command and calls setInputText()
6. Chat input is filled with the message
```

### Message Format
```
I want to use the following components on my site:

• Hero (prestongarrison.com/data/hero.json)
• ProjectsHeader (prestongarrison.com/data/projects-header.json)

Components selected from multi-tenant dashboard.
```

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Start the Servers
```bash
# Terminal 1: Astro dev server
cd astro-multi-tenant && npm run dev
# Runs on http://localhost:4321

# Terminal 2: Go backend
cd backend && go run ./cmd/server
# Runs on http://localhost:3001
```

### 2. Open VSCode Extension
- Open VSCode with the Coders in Flow extension
- Make sure the chat panel is open (Cmd+Shift+P -> "Coders in Flow: Focus on Chat View")

### 3. Use the Dashboard
1. Navigate to http://localhost:4321
2. Select a site from dropdown
3. Click checkboxes to select components in the iframe
4. Click "Send to VSCode" button

### 4. Expected Result
- The message should appear in the VSCode chat input box automatically
- If VSCode isn't responding, the message will be copied to clipboard as fallback

## Triggering the Command Directly

You can also test the command directly:

### From Command Palette
```
Cmd+Shift+P -> "Developer: Run Command"
Enter: codersinflow.sendMessage
Arguments: ["Test message from dashboard"]
```

### From URI
Open this link in browser:
```
vscode://command/codersinflow.sendMessage?args=["Test message"]
```

### From JavaScript Console
```javascript
// In any webpage
const message = "I want to use these components...";
const encodedMessage = encodeURIComponent(JSON.stringify([message]));
window.location.href = `vscode://command/codersinflow.sendMessage?args=${encodedMessage}`;
```

## Troubleshooting

### If message doesn't appear in VSCode:
1. **Check chat panel is open** - The ReactChatViewProvider must be instantiated
2. **Check extension is running** - Reload VSCode window if needed
3. **Check browser console** - Look for errors when clicking "Send to VSCode"
4. **Use clipboard fallback** - Message is always copied to clipboard

### Debug Points:
- `UICommandMessageService.ts:105` - Check if fillChatInput action is received
- `ChatPanel.tsx:1342` - Check if fillChatInput command is received
- `chat-commands.ts:72` - Check if sendMessage command is triggered

## Benefits

1. **Direct Integration** - No manual copy/paste needed
2. **Uses Existing Infrastructure** - Follows the unified messaging architecture
3. **Fallback Support** - Clipboard copy if VSCode isn't available
4. **Visual Feedback** - Green outlines for selected components
5. **Multi-Site Support** - Select components from any site

## Future Enhancements

1. **HTTP Endpoint** - Add server in extension to receive messages directly
2. **WebSocket** - Real-time bidirectional communication
3. **Component Preview** - Show preview of selected components
4. **Batch Operations** - Select/deselect all components at once
5. **Filtering** - Filter components by type or name
